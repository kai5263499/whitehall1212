[Whitehall 1212](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_1212) is the former number of Scotland Yard. I figured it's a fitting name for a package intended to help with the [Scotland Yard board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Yard_(board_game)). This is a [persuit-evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pursuit-evasion) board game that contains 200 positions connected by various transportation means. Persuers, called detectives, are tasked with intercepting the evader, called Mr X.

The goal of this library is to explore the various graph problems that are expressed in the game design.
